Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: You tell git to create the hidden directories it will need to track the files in that directory.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
	you think it offers?
A: The staging area is different from the working directory because it only contains the files that
	will be added to the repository after the commit, so some files in the working directory may be
	left alone and untracked. It is different than the repository in that it doesn't hold the different
	versions of files.  I think it is a good earmark for the files that the user wants to commit, and
	while also leaving alone the files that the user doesn't want to commit.
	
Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: Using git diff you can verify the changes in the files and exclude any files/changes that wouldn't
	make sense in the commit

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would
	branches help?
A: If I wanted to re-work the code knowing that it may introduce new bugs or have features malfunction
